#### This is a tutorial for deep learning course which includes some experiments. Every experiment uses tensorflow as the implementation platform.

#### [tf-model-manip.py](tf-model-manip.py)
- A tool for checking your network design.
- **Useage**: `tf-model-manip.py model.py`
- Requirements: 
  1. a python file called model.py
  2. a class called **Model** with a **build** method in model.py

#### Docker-materials
- A folder includes some files to help you create a docker for experiments.

#### Note
- If this is your first time doing homeworks, please create a docker first. You can read Docker.md for more informations.

### GPU servers
- We provide some servers, each server has eight Nvidia GPU for students to do all the experiments.
- **python** and **tensorflow** has already been installed.
- Some lucky guys will get a IP address and a port number to log in a docker on servers.
- You can read Docker.md for more information.

#### Warnings
- **Do not use the computation resource for your private project!!**
- **Do not let anyone who has not selected this course know the username and password of your docker!!**
